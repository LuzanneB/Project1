# Food Decoder

Independence Day (United States) is around the corner and you know what that means..no not the fireworks..I'm talking about having that **summer time barbecue!** :poultry_leg: :hamburger:

You are at your local supermarket and what is a barbecue without hot dogs? You head to the meat section and with great delight, you immediately noticed a holiday sale on your favorite brand of beef franks!

You head back to pick up the smaller package, but then you noticed that the packaging looks a bit different...Out of curiosity, you checked the nutritional label to see what makes this product different from the one you originally wanted.

I think I've seen that somewhere before..I think in my chewing gum?...Hydrolized Corn Protein? Okay it has plant protein too, but what does "Hydrolized" mean?*

As your stream of thoughts guided you through a rabbit hole of questions and, ever so briefly, enter a state of existentialism; you've accepted that a sale is a sale and the festivities must happen. But, what are we putting into our body? Honey is honey and cinnamon is cinnamon, but what is Xanthan gum? How about tert-Butylhydroquinone? The underlying magnitude of this decision could ripple and affect your long term health in future--all because of the choice you make now. In the conciseness with similar sentiments shared in words from a renown food expert and enviromentalist, Joan Gussow:

> As for butter versus margarine, I trust cows more than chemists.
