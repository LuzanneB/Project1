# Food Decoder

Independence Day (United States) is around the corner and you know what that means..no not the fireworks..I'm talking about having that **summertime barbecue!** :poultry_leg: :hamburger:

I think I've seen that somewhere before..I think in my chewing gum?...Hydrolized Corn Protein? Okay it has plant protein too, but what does "Hydrolized" mean?*
